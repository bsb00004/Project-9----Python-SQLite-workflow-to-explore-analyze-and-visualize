# Project 9 -- Python SQLite workflow to explore, analyze, and visualize
### Introduction
In this project, we'll work with data from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/), a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like:

- __population__ - The population as of 2015.
- __population_growth__ - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
- __area__ - The total land and water area.

We are using SQLite database called factbook.db from this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/factbook/factbook.sql/releases). In this project, we'll explore the Python SQLite workflow to explore, analyze, and visualize data from this database. First things first, let's get familiar with the database.
